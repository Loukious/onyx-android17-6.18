# Onyx — Android 17 / Linux 6.18

This repository contains the complete POCO F7 (Onyx/SM8735) module port and a
reproducible GKI build recipe. It tracks Google's `android17-6.18-lts` branch
and fetches the official **KernelSU Next `dev` branch on every build**.

The current Onyx recipe uses Linux **6.18.38** with **400 platform modules**,
**37 additional native GKI modules** for CAN, USB adapters and network facilities,
and **16 wireless firmware files** with their redistribution notices and matching
ATH source. The module snapshot reproduces **5,193 files** from pinned imports
and reviewed patches. See [NetHunter and CAN support](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/port/nethunter-can.md).

The last device-validated checkpoint, source `c683c79`, used **391 platform
modules** and **471 matched modules**. That image set passed Android, KernelSU
root, audio, enforcing SELinux and partition-identity checks on the global POCO
F7 used for development. It includes native WALT and Qualcomm low-power idle,
Gunyah transport and HVC lifetime fixes, battery/IOMMU diagnostics, and
block-backed MTD kernel/pmsg archival. New catalog additions and freshly built
images require their own build, packaging and device validation.

The device target is **Onyx / SM8735**. Android and Geekbench report the platform
name `sun`; the device-tree recipe includes Tuna and Tuna7 with the Onyx overlay.
Both trees pass offline checks. Hardware testing covers the development phone,
not every phone or board revision using those names. China-only notification LED
support and other unconfirmed hardware remain outside the target scope.

Battery aggregation and firmware console availability remain unresolved optional
diagnostics. Automatic block2mtd attachment requires the saved ROM policy change;
Wi-Fi concurrent-channel ROM work is also pending. Broad peripheral, suspend,
power and endurance validation remains. See [current device validation summary](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/validation/onyx-runtime-summary-20261104.md) and [remaining module inventory](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/validation/remaining_391_modules/priorities.md). A new upstream or KernelSU build
requires device validation even when its automated build checks pass.

## Branch layout

- [`ci`](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/tree/ci) is the default
  branch and contains only workflows, automation, and documentation.
- [`android17-6.18-lts`](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/tree/android17-6.18-lts)
  contains the complete GKI source in `common/`, modified modules in `modules/`,
  and the pinned recipe/patches in `port/`. It contains no workflows.
- `upstream/` branches are proposed updates to the source branch. Builds run
  from `ci` and attach their status to the selected source commit and its PR.

## Source layout

On the source branch:

- `common/` contains the complete pinned upstream GKI with the required common
  fixes applied. CI independently recreates and verifies every source file,
  executable bit and symlink before building.
- `modules/` contains all 5,193 materialized, modified source/build files used
  by the module port, including WLAN, IPA, Bluetooth, graphics, audio, camera,
  charging, PMIC/SPMI, clocks, USB and the remaining device driver groups.
- `port/imports.json` records the exact original repositories, commits and Git
  blobs; `port/patches/` stores the complete adaptation series. `port/stage.py`
  reproduces the module tree from these inputs. CI compares it against the
  committed snapshot, so omitted or changed sources fail the build.
- `port/common-patches/` contains required GKI-source corrections. They are
  applied for every build, separately from the optional QDSS diagnostic logs.
- `port/devicetrees/`, configuration fragments and `modules.json` preserve the
  complete device-tree corrections, module options and expected output set.

On the CI branch, `ci/` and `.github/workflows/` provide upstream detection,
patch replay, hosted builds, artifact checks, automatic source promotion and releases.

The stable 6.6 repository and development logs are maintained separately.
Vendor sources keep their original copyright and license notices; see COPYING.

## Automated updates and builds

The tracker runs daily at 05:00 UTC or through **Run workflow**. It checks
Google's LTS branch and KernelSU Next dev. A new kernel revision produces an
`upstream/` branch with updated common pins, private-header blob imports,
patch hashes and the complete module snapshot. Exact patch replay is required;
an upstream conflict fails the update without changing the accepted source branch.
Already integrated CoreSight fixes are excluded from the effective patch.

The tracker opens a pull request and explicitly dispatches its complete build
(GitHub's default token does not trigger a workflow from its own push).
Successful updates automatically fast-forward `android17-6.18-lts` to the exact
tested source commit, merging the update PR. A concurrent change to the source
branch stops promotion until a new candidate has been rebuilt. The source
branch remains pinned and reproducible. A KernelSU-only update rebuilds the
accepted kernel without changing its GKI source. Successful accepted-source
builds publish their verified artifacts before recording their exact revisions,
so unchanged released inputs do not cause daily rebuilds. The daily tracker also
rebuilds manual source-branch changes, checking out the exact detected commit.
Active and successful builds for the same detected inputs are deduplicated.
Failed or cancelled builds can retry up to three times; further automatic attempts
require changed inputs. Manual workflow runs remain available for source repairs.
KernelSU is fetched from dev at build time; the release records the revision
actually built if dev advances between detection and compilation.

Builds use standard `ubuntu-24.04` GitHub-hosted runners with build dependencies,
swap, persistent compilation caches, artifact and ABI uploads. The 6.18 build uses pinned Android Kleaf/Clang/Rust instead of the
6.6 build script. Build parallelism follows the runner's available CPUs (up to
four), with 3,000 MB reserved for the OS.
Runner cleanup must leave at least 55 GiB free before source sync; bounded
swap allocation fails visibly if space is unavailable. No persistent secrets
are needed. Repository Actions must be allowed to create pull requests.

Every build includes GKI, all 400 platform modules, the native GKI archive,
KernelSU dev's exact source archive, both device-tree variants, wireless firmware
with licenses/source, import CRC verification, input hashes and logs. Download
the complete GKI/module archive and `SHA256SUMS` from the build artifacts or release.
Actions stores separate ABI files under `kernel-abi/`; releases expose those files
individually. Releases also include AnyKernel3 and internal WLAN installer ZIPs;
see the installation scope below.
CI does not flash devices.

Successful ordinary builds of accepted source automatically create a GitHub
release. A successful upstream candidate is first fast-forwarded to the exact
tested commit, then released; promotion does not wait for a manual PR merge.
The release job independently rechecks the downloaded archive, complete named
module inventory, hashes, matching ABI/vermagic, KernelSU configuration/source,
  both device trees and exact source/GKI/KernelSU revisions. Failed builds, changed
source heads and diagnostic or other manual candidate refs are excluded.

Tags have the form `gki-6.18.N-s<SOURCE12>-k<KSU12>` and point to the built
source commit. All assets upload to a draft first; CI verifies the uploaded
inventory, sizes and available server SHA256 digests before publishing. Upload
failure leaves an unpublished draft that a subsequent successful build can
recover. Existing complete releases are preserved. `release.json` binds the
assets to the exact build run and attempt. Artifact names include the build
attempt, so a complete rerun can upload fresh outputs and a release-only rerun
reuses the original successful build's artifact and verification. Promotion and
release share one serial job group; the accepted head is checked again immediately
before publication, preventing an older upload from becoming Latest afterward.
These automatic releases establish
build verification; hardware validation remains a separate step.

The publisher retains the release ID returned by draft creation and uses that
ID for uploads, verification and publication. A new draft need not be visible
through its tag or the release listing. Upload retries reuse assets whose size
and server digest already match, and replace incomplete uploads within that draft.
When a build succeeds but publication fails, run **Recover a verified GKI
release** on `ci` with the original `build_run_id` and `build_attempt`. It uses
the original immutable artifact and current publication code without rebuilding.

Each release summarizes the Google common commits since the preceding published
GKI release, with area counts, linked commit subjects and the complete Google log
range. A release using the same Google revision says that explicitly.

The tracker also detects older build state without a published-release tag and
dispatches one migration build. Accepted input state is written only after the
release is published or an existing complete release is confirmed.

## Build the ROM kernel from source

The [ROM source-build manifest branch](https://github.com/Loukious/local_manifests_onyx/tree/evolution-cnb-konoha618) of
[`local_manifests_onyx`](https://github.com/Loukious/local_manifests_onyx/tree/evolution-cnb-konoha618)
syncs this source branch to `kernel/platform/kernel-6.18`. Apply the matching
[`crdroid_onyx_patches`](https://github.com/Loukious/crdroid_onyx_patches/tree/evolution-cnb-konoha618)
branch, then run the normal ROM build. `port/rom/BoardConfig.mk` connects Lineage's
Kleaf path to `port/rom/build.py`; it compiles GKI, every platform/native module
and the device trees from the verified source recipe. Android packages the boot
images and DLKM partitions from that single build. Userspace headers are generated
from the same synced GKI/module source. No release Image or module binaries are
downloaded for this route. KernelSU Next dev is resolved on every build.

Local kernel objects persist under
`out/target/product/onyx/obj/KERNEL_BAZEL_OUT/kleaf-cache`. Kleaf's supported
`--config=local --cache_dir=...` mode reuses unchanged compilation outputs; source,
configuration and ABI checks still run. The GitHub build also preserves Bazel
action records and their outputs, so a fresh runner can reuse content-checked
results despite new checkout timestamps. It restores and saves these caches
with keys separated by toolchain/configuration and diagnostic
mode. This is incremental compilation, not reuse of a previously released kernel.
A cold build still performs full compilation. Cache timings depend on what changed.

For standalone builds, pass `--cache-dir /path/to/persistent/kleaf-cache` to
`port/build.py`. ROM builds enable it automatically. Resource defaults are 12 jobs
and 20000 MB for Kleaf; override `TARGET_KERNEL_PORT_JOBS` and
`TARGET_KERNEL_PORT_MEMORY_MB` in the device configuration when needed.
`KERNEL_OBJ/onyx-source-build.json` records source revisions, KernelSU, module
inventory, validation results and output hashes for the ROM being packaged.

## Install a release

[GitHub releases](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/releases) include:

- **AnyKernel3 installer ZIP**: recovery installer for the kernel.
- `nethunter-wlan-injection-<kernel-release>.zip`: optional KernelSU/Magisk module
  containing the matching internal WCN7750 monitor-mode/frame-injection driver.
- **GKI and modules archive** (`.tar.gz`): complete outputs for ROM integration;
  this archive is not directly flashable.
- `SHA256SUMS`, `release.json` and `installers.json`: checksums and exact build inputs.

### Update an existing matched 6.18 installation

1. Download the two ZIPs and `SHA256SUMS` from the same release. Verify each ZIP,
   for example `sha256sum *AnyKernel3*.zip`, against its checksum entry.
2. On an unlocked Onyx already running Android 17 / 6.18 with the same KMI
   generation, open custom recovery and mount the target ROM's system/vendor
   DLKM partitions read-only. Flash the AnyKernel3 ZIP. It checks the active boot
   kernel generation and every accessible target DLKM and early vendor-ramdisk
   module's imported symbol CRCs before updating the active `boot` partition.
   An incompatible or unavailable module set aborts installation before flashing.
3. Boot Android. To install the optional WLAN package, select its ZIP inside
   KernelSU or Magisk, then reboot. It requires the exact running kernel release,
   checks the driver payload, waits for dependencies and preserves Wi-Fi's on/off
   state. Failed replacement attempts reload the original driver where possible;
   removing the module and rebooting restores the ROM's normal driver loading.

The WLAN ZIP contains the same injection-enabled driver as the complete build
archive. A ROM already shipping that driver does not need a second copy.
Installer checks and automated build verification do not establish that a new
kernel release has passed device testing.

See [WCN7750 monitor injection testing](port/wlan-test/README.md) for supported
data/control frames, radiotap options, firmware limits and temporary module
replacement with an original-driver restore path.

### Keep Android Wi-Fi connected during monitor use

The internal WCN7750 driver includes experimental STA/monitor coexistence. It
is disabled by default; load the matching module with `sta_monitor_coexist=1`
to opt in. The parameter is read-only after loading. Replacing the module still
requires Android's Wi-Fi framework to shut down and release the old driver.
Once connected, Android keeps its normal STA/HAL active while a separate `mon0`
shares the same radio. This requires exactly one connected STA with one active
link and the same full channel definition, including bandwidth and center
frequencies. A request for the identical definition leaves that sharing intact.
A same-primary request with a different width, center or puncturing is rejected
without disconnecting Android.

A request for a different supported primary channel hands the radio to the
monitor: Android disconnects, while `mon0`, its ifindex and open capture remain
in place. Exclusive targets are enabled 2.4/5 GHz channels with 20/40/80 MHz
bandwidth, without DFS, passive-only operation, puncturing or a second center.
Unsupported targets, including 6 GHz, are rejected before disconnecting Android.
While exclusive, Android scans and new connections cannot run. Closing the
monitor releases the radio and resumes any still-valid deferred Android
scheduled scan (PNO), allowing Android to reconnect. The internal radio does
not provide two independent channels at once.

Device testing passed a channel 52/80 MHz to channel 1/20 MHz handoff while
retaining the same monitor interface and capture process. Android rejoined
about two seconds after monitor teardown. Known-PIN WPS passed both after
handoff and against a different BSSID on the shared channel; the shared-channel
run received all 1,410 Android connectivity-check pings. This exact driver
also passed a 35-minute post-teardown stability observation without rebooting
or reporting a critical kernel fault.

The Kali chroot must have `/dev` mounted. Use a Bully build with native ACK
reception, channel preservation, per-packet FCS handling and early-reply
retention; that build needs no wrapper or compatibility preload. Capture
availability and metadata differ between RAW, firmware management and bounded
EAPOL copies. See the [setup, limits and runtime results](port/wlan-test/README.md#keep-android-wi-fi-connected).

### Run a Kali hostapd AP with a monitor

Patch 0252 adds a separate experimental AP/monitor option. Bounded device
checks passed with a WPA2 client on channel 5 at 20 MHz. Load the matched module
with
`ap_monitor_coexist=1`; it is disabled by default and read-only after loading.
The existing `sta_monitor_coexist=1` can also be supplied to enable the
alternative STA workflow. These flags do not enable connected STA+AP+MON
operation.

This path uses Kali hostapd with an ordinary nl80211 AP interface. Fully stop
Android Wi-Fi management and background/scheduled scanning first. Start
hostapd, wait for the AP to become ready, then create and raise `mon0`. One real,
non-MLO AP owns the complete channel definition: enabled non-DFS 2.4/5 GHz,
20/40/80 MHz, matching primary and center frequencies, no second segment and
no puncturing. An unequal monitor retune or user-requested AP channel switch
returns busy; close the monitor before reconfiguring the AP.

Closing and deleting `mon0` releases its resources while hostapd retains the
AP. Both share airtime and radio resources, so capture and injection can affect
client throughput and latency. Android hotspot integration and seamless
recovery across a Wi-Fi subsystem restart are outside this mode. See the
[AP setup, device results and capture limits](port/wlan-test/README.md#run-a-kali-hostapd-ap-with-mon0).

### Migrate from 6.6 or a different KMI generation

An AnyKernel kernel update cannot perform this migration. It needs a complete
matched image set built around the ROM's ramdisks, module lists, labels, device
trees and partition sizes. In particular, a KMI 5 installation cannot take a
KMI 6 kernel while retaining its incompatible modules.

The [Onyx recovery package generator](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/port/recovery/README.md)
can create a matched recovery ZIP for an explicitly supported, exact ROM
baseline. **That per-ROM migration ZIP is generated separately and is not the
AnyKernel ZIP in regular releases.** Read its profile and verification report
before using it; an experimental profile may cover an older source checkpoint.

For a prepared matched ZIP:

1. Verify the ZIP's companion SHA256 file and read its profile/report. Keep full
   original partition images on the PC. The profile binds the active slot's
   `boot`, `vendor_boot`, `dtbo`, `system_dlkm`, `vendor_dlkm`, `init_boot` and
   `vbmeta` bytes and sizes; a matching ROM version name alone is insufficient.
2. Use the custom recovery and tools listed in the [installer guide](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/port/recovery/README.md).
   This route requires an already unlocked Onyx, AVB flags 3, mounted `/metadata`,
   no active OTA snapshots, and unmounted linear DLKM devices. It does not prepare
   a locked, verified stock phone for installation.
3. Select the generated matched ZIP in recovery. After its preflight checks, the
   installer backs up and verifies all five target partitions under `/metadata/ota`.
   It writes `system_dlkm`, `vendor_dlkm`, `dtbo`, `vendor_boot`, then `boot`, and
   reads back every image. The other slot, `init_boot` and `vbmeta` are retained.
4. Reboot after a successful installation. A write/readback failure attempts a
   complete verified rollback. If rollback fails, keep the recovery session open
   and restore the matching originals through fastbootd using the reported backup
   path before rebooting.

To package another ROM baseline on a Linux PC, supply its full-size partition
dumps, verified module-layout checkout, ROM file contexts and Android image tools
to `port/recovery/profile.py` and `port/recovery/generate.py`. The generator writes
images and a ZIP locally; it does not flash the phone. Follow the complete
[per-ROM commands and supported layouts](https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18/blob/android17-6.18-lts/port/recovery/README.md). Unsupported profiles are rejected, and the generator never writes phone
partitions.

## Manual workflow

Select **Build Android 17 6.18 GKI and Onyx modules** on the `ci` branch.
`source_ref` defaults to `android17-6.18-lts`; select an update branch, tag or
complete commit to build a candidate. The `diagnostic` option adds QDSS logging.
Leave `source_revision` and `kernelsu_revision` blank for manual builds; the
tracker supplies them to identify exact detected inputs and suppress duplicates.

## Local build

Requirements: Linux x86-64, Git, Python 3.12+, Android `repo`, GNU patch, C
build tools, kmod and enough free disk for the source and Kleaf outputs.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch android17-6.18-lts https://github.com/Loukious/onyx-android17-6.18 source
python3 source/port/rom/build.py --source source \
    --workspace /path/to/persistent-workspace \
    --output /path/to/kernel-outputs --jobs 12 --memory-mb 20000
```

This verifies the committed GKI/module snapshots, prepares the pinned build
dependencies, compiles the kernel and modules with an incremental cache, and
exports matching Android packaging inputs. Keep the workspace and output outside
the source checkout and separate from each other. ROM builds invoke this adapter
automatically through the device configuration.

For low-level recipe development, use the prepare/stage/build helpers in `port/`
and the independent snapshot checkers in `ci/`. Strict patch application,
source-preservation guards and ABI checks remain enabled.
