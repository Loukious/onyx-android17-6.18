# timerfd resume notification during s2idle

An Onyx trace captured a kernel-generated timerfd cancellation notification
ending s2idle while userspace was still frozen. The notification ran on an
ordinary workqueue after a CPU briefly left idle. Its epoll watcher used
`EPOLLWAKEUP`, so notifying the watcher activated a wake source and ended the
system sleep attempt.

The phone was running Linux `6.18.38-android17-5-maybe-dirty-4k`. Caffeine was
off, the screen was locked, and USB was disconnected for the capture. USB and
charging wake locks had prevented system suspend in an earlier connected test.

Of 134 complete `machine_suspend` spans retained in the unplugged trace, 118
had `timerfd_resume_work` as the first recorded wake-source activation, three
had `qrtr_ws`, and 13 had no retained activation. Some per-CPU buffers wrapped;
these counts describe retained events, not an exhaustive wake history.

One complete example, with times from the same trace:

| Timestamp | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 43614.030634 | `machine_suspend[1] begin` |
| 43614.030670 | `timekeeping_freeze[1] begin` |
| 43614.341538 | `timekeeping_freeze[1] end` |
| 43614.341743 | `[timerfd]` wake-source activation |
| 43614.341989 | `machine_suspend[1] end` |

The wake-source stack included `timerfd_resume_work`, `timerfd_clock_was_set`,
`ep_poll_callback` and `__pm_stay_awake`. Device resume and userspace thaw
followed. AlarmManager's disarmed `CLOCK_REALTIME` timerfd had
`TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME | TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET`; its epoll registration included
`EPOLLWAKEUP`. This is Android's clock-change watcher, not an expiring alarm.

[tick_unfreeze()](../common/kernel/time/tick-common.c) resumes timekeeping on
the first CPU to leave s2idle. [timekeeping_resume()](../common/kernel/time/timekeeping.c)
then calls [timerfd_resume()](../common/fs/timerfd.c). A CPU idle exit does not
by itself mean that the system should finish suspending. The old
`schedule_work()` call nevertheless let this userspace notification execute
while the suspend freezer was active.

The fix queues this one work item on `system_freezable_wq`. Workqueue freezing
holds it pending until thaw, and repeated resume requests coalesce. It still
executes normally when workqueues are awake. The work item is static and holds
no saved timerfd context pointers; the existing RCU walk and per-context locks
protect timerfd lifetime when the notification is eventually delivered.
The suspend path thaws workqueues during actual system resume or suspend
unwind, so no new explicit flush or userspace dependency is introduced.

Timer expiration and explicit clock-setting calls retain their existing paths.
This correction does not change the ROM, AlarmManager, parallel module
loading, WLAN roaming policy, firmware replies, PM timeout values or error
propagation.

The WLAN messages have a separate, precise meaning:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| WoW NACK reason 7 | `WMI_WOW_NON_ACK_REASON_ROAM`: firmware roaming holds a lock. |
| PMO status 3 | `QDF_STATUS_E_AGAIN`. |
| Linux status -11 | `-EAGAIN`, abort this suspend attempt and retry. |

The original retained log contains a reason-7 refusal. The later unplugged
trace did not reproduce reason 7: it retained one reason-0 NACK, followed by
a successful firmware ACK 1.147344 seconds later. The inspected WLAN
suspend/ACK code matches the pinned vendor baseline; the newer Xiaomi source
checked for this investigation has the same PMO suspend implementation.
There is no evidence here of a stuck host PM reference or a Link to PC change
to WLAN suspend handling. Indirect effects of application network activity
have not been excluded.

This patch addresses the demonstrated kernel wakeup path and the resulting
extra suspend/resume cycles. It does not establish that all firmware roaming
refusals will disappear. Suppressing or ignoring a firmware NACK would allow
the host to suspend before firmware is ready and is not a valid fix.

The disposable QEMU comparison exercises the actual kernel workqueue freezer
and actual timerfd code, with a test-only include in `fs/timerfd.c`:

| Check | Baseline | Candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Awake resume callback executes | Pass | Pass |
| 100 resume requests stay pending until thaw, then execute once | Fails: callback runs while frozen | Pass |
| Repeated freeze/thaw cycles | Fails: callback runs while frozen | Pass |
| Expiry on MONOTONIC, BOOTTIME, REALTIME and both ALARM clocks | 5 pass | 5 pass |
| Disarmed CANCEL_ON_SET setup and two explicit clock changes | 3 pass | 3 pass |

The tests freeze only workqueues inside a disposable VM. They do not freeze
the host or change its clock. Reproduce with a static C runtime, the normal
kernel build dependencies, and QEMU installed:

```sh
python3 port/tests/run_timerfd_vm.py \
  /path/to/unmodified/common /path/to/patched/common /path/to/new-vm-output
```

The runner requires the original kernel to fail the two freezer checks and
the candidate to pass all three. It also requires all eight timerfd API checks
to pass on both kernels, and saves logs, source/configuration/image hashes and
a report. The VM tests do not establish phone sleep residency or WLAN firmware
behavior after the change. The test include is never used by the production
ARM64 build. The matched temporary image has now been tested on the phone,
as described below.

The replay component is
[timerfd-resume-freezer.patch](common-patches/timerfd-resume-freezer.patch).
The aggregate and common-source manifest include its exact input/output hashes.
Replay verification checked all 21 affected files and their exact restoration
after the build context exited.

The [validation receipt](validation/timerfd-resume-20261106.json) records the
reproducible VM results, complete 91,829-file source replay and a successful
production ARM64 Kleaf build with strict KMI and symbol-list checks. That build
uses the current recipe's KernelSU Next revision `b2c1ad00b755`.
The running phone's saved Image hash instead matches the earlier accepted
baseline with KernelSU Next `a6c81fa4a8b7`. A device comparison must use that saved
baseline's configuration and source inputs to isolate the timerfd change.

## Phone validation on 2026-11-06

The matched temporary kernel booted on slot B with build ID
`a95103924cbfa65100a16e293beacdac2d63e21b`. Its configuration, KernelSU Next revision,
all 10,091 exported-symbol/CRC records and boot ramdisk/header fields match
the saved phone baseline. No partition was written.

With Caffeine off, the phone locked and USB unplugged, the new capture retained
30 complete sleep spans with no overruns or dropped events. None was first
woken by `timerfd_resume_work`; all 30 timerfd notification stacks occurred
during userspace thaw, after machine suspend ended. This validates the intended
ordering on the device.

Overall sleep remains short: median 0.363164 seconds and maximum 0.714848
seconds, versus 0.257711 and 0.959437 seconds in the retained original capture.
`qrtr_ws` was the first wake in 24 spans; six had no recorded activation.
These are different capture windows, not a controlled residency benchmark.
The candidate capture recorded 83 firmware ACKs and one reason-0 NACK, with
no reason-7 NACK. This is a validated timerfd correction, not a demonstrated
fix for all short sleeps or the original roaming refusal. Temporary diagnostic
probes were removed.

The follow-up investigation identified the QRTR traffic as repeated modem WDS
`0x8e` indications after SELinux denied nicmd's netlink queries and interface
creation. Translating that daemon's existing route/XFRM grants into explicit
message permissions allowed the missing RMNET interfaces to be created. This
is a separate ROM policy correction. With the temporary policy applied, an
unplugged capture retained 98 complete sleep spans, zero WDS `0x8e`
indications, zero QRTR first wakes and zero netlink permission failures, with
no trace overruns or drops. Median sleep duration was 1.640443 seconds; most
remaining IRQ wakes were WLAN_CE_2. The original policy was then restored and
fully verified, with SELinux enforcing throughout. These separate captures
do not establish battery-life improvement or eliminate firmware-busy replies.

## Remaining WLAN traffic and current-source integration

A subsequent unplugged capture retained 50 complete sleep spans without trace
drops and no firmware NACKs. Thirty first firmware wakes carried PC UDP traffic
to Link to Windows; a passive native trace identified its two-second Nano
transport keepalives. The phone's framework files matched the original ROM
baseline, and the custom Link to PC framework payload was inactive.

A controlled Windows lock/unlock comparison confirmed that this transport
closes when Windows locks. Excluding transition boundaries, the 93.143-second
locked interval had zero native keepalive/data callbacks. The connection was
recreated and keepalives resumed after unlock. No trace events were lost.
The PC owner was Microsoft's CrossDeviceService background process. Closing
the Phone Link window alone did not stop that process's session. This test
used USB and establishes connection lifecycle, not sleep residency. Keeping
Windows locked is a diagnostic condition, not a proposed power-management fix.

The source correction is also integrated on accepted source commit
`8a10a2823370f0830364cf57238e20d009bd886b`, which pins common revision
`ed4489e76f6fafbe67b99e8a9419215313df189e`. The timerfd/freezer implementation
did not change in that intervening upstream update. The conflict resolution
preserves the newer baseline hashes for GKI configuration and Kleaf module
rules while adding the timerfd patch's unchanged hashes. The original VM,
ARM64 and phone results above apply to their recorded inputs; a fresh complete
build is required before publishing binaries from this newer source base.
