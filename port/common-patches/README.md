# Required common-kernel fixes

`build.py` applies these fixes on every build after KernelSU integration. The
patch and manifest hashes must match the reviewed input and output sources.
The build archives the patched files in `common-fixes/source/` and restores
the pinned checkout afterward, preserving the KernelSU verification contract.
This is the persistent production fix path; `--qdss-diagnostic` independently
controls the temporary AMBA/clock logging.

`0001-required-common-fixes.patch` combines the nine-driver removal fix from
[Jie Gan's July v3 series](https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2026/07/10/60).
The CoreSight portion matches
[patch 1/2](https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2026/07/10/62) exactly.
Imported Onyx funnel code receives the same callback change through patch
`0175` in the normal source staging pipeline.

[Patch 2/2](https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2026/07/10/61) changes
`itnoc_remove()`, which does not exist in the pinned 6.18 tree. Its TNOC driver
uses AMBA clock ownership and remains unchanged. Both original messages are
preserved under `validation/clock_suspend_resume/`.

The same patch adds `thermal_device_register()` and its GPL export for the
Xiaomi thermal policy module. It creates devices through the thermal class
without exposing private class internals. `required-common-fixes.patch` keeps
the complete replay input so CI can preserve local thermal changes as LTS
integrates the CoreSight fixes. See `../mi-thermal-interface.md` for the ABI and
validation details.

The removal correction resumes the platform device before teardown, disables
runtime PM, marks it suspended, and drops the usage vote without suspending
again. Devres then releases the enabled clock vote once. The submitted patch
ignores the result of `pm_runtime_get_sync()`; clock balance therefore assumes
successful runtime resume. Lifecycle tests preserve and document that limit.

This series does not include the separately discussed September platform
probe-failure fix. Neither removal tests nor a clean startup establish the
cause of the historical warnings from `amba_pm_runtime_suspend()`.

The native CTI port also protects the shared CTI association callbacks with
SRCU. Register/unregister callbacks can sleep while changing the graph;
`coresight_remove_cti_ops()` publishes NULL and drains existing callbacks before
the CTI module can unload. It holds no graph mutex while waiting. The actual
wrappers have concurrent add/remove-versus-unload host tests in
`verify_cti_assoc.py`, and the normal GKI build checks the real SRCU API.

The HVC extension uses `0002-required-common-fixes-with-hvc.patch`. The original required patch and pre-HVC manifest are preserved; `hvc-core.patch` is the independently reviewed second component. Its public certificate and trusted-key config preserve signed accepted GKI compatibility without disabling module protection. New-file before hashes are null and those files are removed on context exit.

The `0004-required-common-fixes-with-timerfd.patch` aggregate
retains the NetHunter/CAN additions in `0003` and adds
`timerfd-resume-freezer.patch`. The latter queues timerfd's resume notification
on `system_freezable_wq`, so an intermediate s2idle CPU exit cannot notify an
`EPOLLWAKEUP` waiter before the system has actually resumed. Timer expiry and
explicit clock-change notification paths retain their existing behavior.
See [the diagnosis and validation](../timerfd-s2idle.md).

The current aggregate is `0005-required-common-fixes-with-blk-plug-ordering.patch`.
It adds `blk-plug-timestamp-ordering.patch`: a compiler barrier between plug
timestamp flag clearing and plug detachment, with AutoFDO left enabled.
The manifest opts this file into the CI updater's reviewed ordering check.
An upstream barrier in either the teardown or the flush helper retires the
local addition; unfamiliar control flow stops the update for review. The
original replay patch is retained so an upstream revert reactivates it.
See [the ordering fix and detection limits](../blk-plug-ordering.md).
